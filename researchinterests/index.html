	<h1 class="title">Statement of Research Interests</h1>
	<p class="lead">My research examines how concepts and arguments developed in ancient Greek and Roman moral and political philosophy may contribute to the solution of contemporary social, political, and moral problems.</p>
	<p>In my current research, I examine the theme of cosmopolitan justice, as it was developed in the Socratic tradition. While much scholarship addresses cosmopolitan justice from the background of the modern liberal tradition of universal human rights, my work aims to show in what ways persons are morally and politically bound to one another through practices of moral development. Particularly, I argue that the training of virtue, the core moral discipline of ancient eudaimonism, entails concentric moral and political relations to other persons and that, contrary to some prominent trends in scholarship, the full, active, and successful life that drives the eudaimonism of antiquity demands the reciprocal moral and political development of others as much as it demands such development of the self. My interest in this area developed out of my doctoral dissertation, which examined the philosophy of moral development in Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. I ague that whereas modern philosophers believed the world ought to be reshaped to reflect one’s own internal procedures and principles, the ancient philosophers understood that moral development required that the one making progress should be formed with respect to real values already in the natural and social world. I conclude that moral development requires the formation of habits of attention and that, if we are to make progress, then we must critically attend to our selves, other persons, and our world. Accordingly, loving, as a virtue of attention, becomes paramount; distraction and apathy are its corresponding vices.</p>
	<p>My study of moral development crosses several of philosophy’s value fields, including ethics, moral psychology, and social and political philosophy—from the person to the environment of values in which she lives. Whereas my dissertation studied one side of this pole, learning virtue, my current research studies the other, justice, community, and social institutions. To this end, I currently have two research projects in preparation. First, my article “Diogenes the Cynic on Law and World Citizenship” considers the conception of cosmopolitanism among the ancient Greek and Roman Cynics. I argue that the Cynic conception of cosmopolitanism is not merely negative—rejecting convention—but also positive—demanding the moral cultivation of others. I presented this paper at the 2016 meeting of the Society of Ancient Greek Philosophy, and I have expanded it into an article for publication. This article is the first stage in a book project I am calling The Republics, which closely examines the arguments concerning justice and the common good in the politeia genre in classical and Hellenistic philosophy, including the Politeiai written by Plato, Xenophon, the Old Oligarch, Diogenes the Cynic, Aristotle and his students, and Zeno, the founder of the Stoa. </p>
	<p>My second research project examines justice, law, and the common good among the Epicureans. The Epicureans belong to an atomistic tradition that grew up alongside the Socratic tradition in Hellenistic world. The Epicureans, however, are arguably more modern than their Socratic counterparts. In my article, “Lucretius’ Pragmatic Argument: De rerum natura 4.500–521,” which I presented at the 2016 Penn Ancient Workshop and which I am currently preparing for publication, I argue that the Roman Epicurean Lucretius innovated a pragmatic criterion of correct judgment. The innovation of the pragmatic criterion shows how Lucretius argues against the skeptics of his time and also shows the nascent development of a self-correcting and modern scientific enterprise. A second article in the early stages of research, “Political Life without Politics? The Epicureans on Law and the Common Good,” which I recently presented at the 2017 meeting of the Society of Ancient Greek Philosophy, examines how this pragmatic criterion plays a role in the Epicurean conception of social and political progress. I hope to build these two papers into a larger project focusing on Epicureanism and its reception.</p>
